# signtractions

## What is signtractions

Signtractions project is set of pytraction tractions, tractors, models and resources which wraps functionality of pubtools-sign project to provide
containerized container singing.

## How to use signtractions

### Locally
1. Install signtractions on your local machine
2. Run following python command to excute tractor or traction from signtractions
```
cat run_arguments.yml | python -m pytractions.cli run signtractions.<path-to-traction/tractor-you-want-to-run>:<Traction-or-Tractor-Class>
```

### In Container
2. Run following python command to excute tractor or traction from signtractions in a container
```
cat run_arguments.yml | podman -v userdata:/userdata run -i signtractions:latest run signtractions.<path-to-traction/tractor-you-want-to-run>:<Traction-or-Tractor-Class>
```

### Tekton task
1. To generate tekton Task spec you can run
```
podman signtractions:latest generate_tekton_task signtractions.<path-to-traction/tractor-you-want-to-run>:<Traction-or-Tractor-Class> quay.io/jluza/signtractions:latest
```
2. To generate tekton TaskRun spec you can run
```
podman signtractions:latest generate_tekton_task_run signtractions.<path-to-traction/tractor-you-want-to-run>:<Traction-or-Tractor-Class> quay.io/jluza/signtractions:latest
```

3. To generate pipeline instead of task, you just pass `--type tractor` after `'generate_tekton_task_run'`. Only tractors can be generated as tekton pipelines


### Generating default inputs
1. To generate yaml file with default inputs used to feed running tractor or tractions (run_arguments.yml in examples above) you can run
```
python -m pytractions.cli generate_inputs signtractions.<path-to-traction/tractor-you-want-to-run>:<Traction-or-Tractor-Class>
```
or
```
podman signtractions:latest generate_inputs signtractions.<path-to-traction/tractor-you-want-to-run>:<Traction-or-Tractor-Class>
```
